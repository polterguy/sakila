# Notice, this file depends upon the 'nginx-proxy' network, the 'nginx-proxy' container,
# and the 'letsencrypt' container existing from the following docker-compose file
#
# https://github.com/polterguy/magic.deploy/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
#
# Hence, this file will only be deployable unchanged on a VPS where you have already deployed
# Magic from before.
#
# If you don't want this, you'll need to pull in the 'nginx-proxy' and 'letsencrypt' containers
# from the above file, to make sure you're correctly setting up the nGinx reverse proxy, and
# the LetsEncrypt cerificate retriever container.
